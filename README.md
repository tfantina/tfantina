I'm curious about many things, spread thin on many things; prioritizing family and learning how to talk to computers in intresting ways.

I'm passionate about Elixir and have spent six years working in multiple Elixir and Phoenix codebases often as the primary or solo developer. Since May of 2025 my day job has shifted to be primairly Ruby based; Elixir is still my passion and I'm finding ways to keep learning and contribute outside of work.

### Day Job Overview
- May 2025 - Present contractor at [Built](https://www.builtapp.com/) working with Ruby, TypeScript and GraphQL.
- Sep 2019 - May 2025 contractor at [Objective](http://objective.dev) working with Elixir, Svelte, and Ruby

### Relevant Projects
- [Camera Obscura](https://github.com/tfantina/camera_obscura) - an Elixir project that provides easy image transformations (resize, format, etc) and uploads out of the box. It's a collection of behaviours and macros(?!) designed to streamline managing image assets uploaded from Phoenix or other apps.
- [Ciao](https://github.com/tfantina/ciao_phx) - expremental social network my intent was to limit the number of connections to about 100, magic links for signing in family members who don't want to create accounts a few other unique features but it never got off the ground.
